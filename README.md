## Description
We made an attachment to the front of the cap which can be used to detect the distance from object. When the object is 2 meters away, the buzzer will start rining to inform the user about the object. As the person gets closer and closer, the sound will become one of a higher frequency. There is also an off button in the system so that the users can off it if they no longer need it.
